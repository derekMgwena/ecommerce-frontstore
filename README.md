Nike-style eCommerce built with Next.js, Drizzle ORM, and Better Auth. In this project you generate sleek product pages powered by Next.js 15, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS. The backend runs on Neon PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM, authentication is handled with Better Auth, and Zustand manages state — all packaged in a clean, modular UI to help you ship faster.

## <a name="tech-stack">⚙️ Tech Stack</a>

- **[Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/)** is a framework-agnostic authentication and authorization library for TypeScript. It provides built-in support for email and password authentication, social sign-on (Google, GitHub, Apple, and more), and multi-factor authentication, simplifying user authentication and account management.

- **[Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/)** is a lightweight and performant TypeScript ORM designed with developer experience in mind. It provides a seamless interface between application code and database operations while maintaining high performance and reliability.

- **[Neon](https://neon.com/)** is a fully managed, serverless PostgreSQL database platform. It offers features like instant provisioning, autoscaling, and database branching, enabling developers to build scalable applications without managing infrastructure.

- **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs)** is a powerful React framework for building full-stack web applications. It simplifies development with features like server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes, enabling developers to focus on building products and shipping quickly.

- **[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** is a utility-first CSS framework that allows developers to build custom, responsive designs quickly without leaving their HTML. It provides pre-defined classes for layout, typography, colors, and more.

- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, providing better tooling, code quality, and error detection for developers. It is ideal for building large-scale applications and enhances the development experience.

- **[Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs)** is a minimal, hook-based state management library for React. It lets you manage global state with zero boilerplate, no context providers, and excellent performance through selective state subscriptions.
